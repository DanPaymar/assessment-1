/*
    The data below has been collected over the 
    last week at an apple orchard. You will be 
    using your coding skills to gain insights 
    into its daily operations.

    Below are three arrays each containing 7
    numbers. You will use them and the price
    variables to complete the problems in 
    this file.

    The indexes of the arrays correspond with a 
    day of the week. The associated number value 
    represents the number of acres that were picked 
    that day.

    The first array is named fujiAcres. Notice 
    that the first item in this array is 2, 
    meaning that 2 acres of Fuji apples were 
    picked on Monday of this week.

    The prices are per pound and are written
    in cents. 
*/

const fujiAcres = [2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1]
const galaAcres = [5, 2, 4, 3, 6, 2, 4]
const pinkAcres = [1, 5, 4, 2, 1, 5, 4]

const fujiPrice = .89
const galaPrice = .64
const pinkPrice = .55



// PROBLEM 1

/*
    Using for loop, calculate the total number
    of acres picked for the entire week.

    Save the number to a variable called 
    `totalAcres`.

    Log `totalAcres` to the console.
*/

// CODE HERE

// create the variable totalAcres and set it's value to 0
let totalAcres = 0 


for (let i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
    totalAcres = totalAcres + fujiAcres[i] + galaAcres[i] + pinkAcres[i]
}
console.log('Total acres picked:', totalAcres)



// PROBLEM 2

/*
    Using `totalAcres`, calculate the average 
    number of acres picked per day. 

    Save the answer to a variable called 
    `averageDailyAcres`. 

    Log `averageDailyAcres` to the console.
*/

// CODE HERE

let averageDailyAcres = 0


averageDailyAcres = totalAcres / 7 // take averageDailyAcres and change its value to totalAcres / 7
console.log(averageDailyAcres) // show the average daily acres in the console


// PROBLEM 3

/*
    We have provided 2 variables below. 
    
    The `acresLeft` variable is the number 
    of acres that still have apples left. 
    
    The `days` variable represents how 
    many more days of work are left. It's 
    initialized at 0 because we're going 
    to be using it as a counter.
    
    Write a while loop that will continue to run
    while `acresLeft` is above 0. 
    
    On each iteration of the loop:
    - add 1 to the `days` variable
    - subtract your daily average from the number of acres left

    Outside the loop, log `days` to the console.

    Note: This is not the most efficient way to
    calculate this number. But! It is a great
    way to get a whole number without using 
    any Math methods. 

*/

let acresLeft = 174
let days = 0

// CODE HERE


while (acresLeft > 0) { // loop acresLeft as long as it is greater than 0
    acresLeft -= averageDailyAcres // subtract acres left by average daily acres each time the loop runs
    console.log('Days left:', days) // log the number of days left

    days++ // increment days variable
}


// PROBLEM 4

/*
    Your next task is to create 3 arrays
    that list the daily amount of apples
    picked, in tons, for each variety.

    Each acre yields 6.5 tons of apples.

    Use the variables below to store
    your new arrays. Make sure that you
    don't modify the original arrays
    on lines 36 - 38.

    Log each of your arrays to the console.

    Hint: you can use the slice method
    to make copies of the arrays and
    then loop the copies. You could also
    make empty arrays, loop the old ones
    and use the push method to add new
    values to the new arrays.
